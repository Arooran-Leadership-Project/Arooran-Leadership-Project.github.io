        There are many types of water pollution, but they are mainly categorized into two main groups.
        There is ground water, which is water seeped into the ground or aquifers. Surface water refers to 
        bodies of water next to land, such as rivers, lakes and oceans. <br><br>
        There are three main ways water gets polluted. The first way is agricultural run off, where 
        fertilizers and pesticides and disolved into run off water and seeps into the ground and 
        aquifers. Another way is waste water, which typically contains pollutants dissolved in it mixing
        with clean water. The third way is just chemicals being dumped into water, like in the picture displayed
        above.<br><br>
        This can result in many hazards for the environment. Water that has been polluted is not safe to drink,
        and is just as dangerous to use for sanitizing things, wheter it be objects or people. It can also 
        severly effecy sea life and any animals that rely of water being a habitat. It also can leech into other
        parts of the ecosystem and pollute other parts of the biosphere.
