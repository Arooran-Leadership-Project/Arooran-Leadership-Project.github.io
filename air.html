          Air pollution is a product of when solid and gas particles are mixed in with the air. This can be in many forms, but one of the many creations of air pollution also ties into 
          climate change.<br><br>

          Air pollution has two main topics. The first topic is health hazardous, such as ozone and smog building up in 
          large and polluted cities. This has many complications on human health, as breathing in these dangerous gases can be detrimental to human health.
          These problems are greater for youth and the elderly, whos immune systems and lungs may not be that great.<br><br>

          The second part is climate change, where greenhouse gases are filling up the earth's atmosphere and is contributing
          to a global rise in tempuratues. This affects the earth in many ways, from rising sea levels to an increase
          in tropical storms. This is espically bad 40% of the world lives near the coast and is increasingly at risk 
          to many of these problems.
