          Pollution is described as a negative effect on any part of an environment’s biosphere. 
          Some examples of pollution are air pollution, water pollution and more.<br><br>
          Pollution can be caused by many ways, but the most common ways are man-made problems. Some of
          these include waste, run-off and greenhouse gases, which all contribute to pollution.<br><br>
          This can disrupt ecosystems and its inhabitants, make land and water inhabitable.
          It is also the reason why up to 1 billion people do not have access to clean drinking water 
          and another 2 billion people to safe sanitation. It is also detrimental to ecosystems, where
          it can the effect the growth of animals, trees and fauna in a habitat.
